I hold a masters in mathematics. After spending my early years in other professions, I am preparing to be a full stack web developer. So far I have learned the following:

* _JavaScript_
* _Problem solving_
* _HTTP and REST_
* _HTML & CSS_
* _React & Next_
* _Node.js, Express, & Pug_
* _MySQL_
* _VSCode (with Vim)_
* _Postman_
* _Git & GitHub_
* _Trello_

# Programming and problem solving

I chose to start with JavaScript as my primary programming language for its versatility. I have familiarized myself with its syntax and features. I put particular emphasis on clear understanding of generic language concepts and constructs (e.g., functions, loops, conditionals, etc.) so that I can switch to another language easily.

Before even starting development, I recognized problem solving as a crucial skill for programmers and started working on it. I practice regularly to improve my algorithms and data structures skill. See my [LeetCode profile.](https://leetcode.com/uhsnigdha/)

I started problem solving with my primary focus on _simulation_ problems in order to improve my implementation skill. After that I covered the basic _sorting_, _searching_, and _number theoretic_ algorithms, including _recursion_ and _backtracking_ techniques. Currently, I am working on _graph algorithms_. I plan to move to other advanced techniques like _greedy algorithms_ and _dynamic programming_ gradually.

I am also preparing myself for time-constrained coding contests like Codeforces and AtCoder.

# Web development

I started by familiarizing myself with the fundamentals of HTTP protocol, the foundation of the web applications. Armed with the knowledge of HTTP, I started creating RESTful APIs capable of CRUD operations using Node.js, Express, and MySQL.

After getting bit more handy with MySQL relational database, I wish to learn a NoSQL database like MongoDB.

Besides raw client-side JavaScript, I am familiar with _React_ and _Next_ frameworks.

VSCode (with Vim) is my primary IDE and I use Postman to test my APIs. I use Git and GitHub for version control. Besides the Git basics, I am familiar with the _pull request_ workflow.

# Productivity

I use Trello to manage my tasks as so far I am working alone. I use Miro to create diagrams and for brainstorming ideas.

# Portfolio projects

I developed a [school management app](https://github.com/uhanicodes/react-school-mgmt) with React and Next. I am still improving it.
