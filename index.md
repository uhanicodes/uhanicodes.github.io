I hold a masters in mathematics. After spending my early years in other professions, I am preparing to be a full stack web developer. So far I have learned the following:

* _JavaScript_
* _Problem solving_
* _HTTP and REST_
* _HTML & CSS_
* _Node.js, Express, & Pug_
* _MySQL_
* _VSCode (with Vim)_
* _Postman_
* _Git & GitHub_
* _Trello_

# Programming and problem solving

I chose to start with JavaScript as my programming language for its versatility. I am familiar with its syntax and features. So far it is my primary language. I put emphasis on clear understanding of generic language concepts and constructs (e.g., functions, loops, conditionals, etc.) so that I can switch to another language easily.

Before even starting development, I recognized problem solving as a crucial skill for programmers and started working on it. I practice regularly to improve my algorithms and data structures skill. See my [LeetCode profile.](https://leetcode.com/uhsnigdha/)

So far my focus had been primarily on _simulation_ and _implementation_ problems so that I can improve my implementation skill. I am currently working on _backtracking_ problems. I plan to move to other advanced techniques like _dynamic programming_ and _graph theory_ gradually.

I am also preparing myself for time-constrained coding contests like Codeforces and AtCoder.

# Web development

I started by familiarizing myself with the fundamentals of HTTP protocol, the foundation of the web applications. Armed with the knowledge of HTTP, I started creating RESTful APIs capable of CRUD operations using Node.js, Express, and MySQL.

After getting bit more handy with MySQL relational database, I wish to learn a NoSQL database like MongoDB.

So far I used Pug as my templating engine. I wish to master a front-end framework like React.

VSCode (with Vim) is my primary IDE and I use Postman to test my APIs. I use Git and GitHub for version control. Besides the Git basics, I am familiar with the _pull request_ workflow.

# Productivity

I use Trello to manage my tasks as so far I am working alone. I use Miro to create diagrams and for brainstorming ideas.
